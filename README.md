# Yelp Dataset Analysis

This repository contains SQL code and analysis for profiling and analyzing the Yelp dataset as part of a Coursera assignment.

# Project Overview
The project is divided into two parts:

- Data profiling and understanding
- Inferences and analysis

# Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding
This section includes SQL queries to:
- Count total records in each table
- Find distinct records using primary and foreign keys
- Check for null values
- Calculate minimum, maximum, and average values for specific columns
- List cities with the most reviews
- Analyze star rating distributions for selected cities

# Part 2: Inferences and Analysis
This section focuses on:
- Comparing businesses with 2-3 stars to those with 4-5 stars
- Analyzing distribution of hours, number of reviews, and location data
- Investigating correlation between number of reviews and fans

# SQL Code
The repository includes SQL queries used for data analysis and profiling. Each query is accompanied by its results and brief explanations.
